                I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at Boston University (Class of 2026) with a strong interest in
                building reliable software and applying data-driven methods to finance. I’ve developed Python tools
                that automate analysis of financial documents and built a full-stack, Dockerized stock-trading app.
                My technical experience ranges from building full-stack web applications with Flask, React, and Docker,
                to automating financial data pipelines with Python and BeautifulSoup. I enjoy solving challenging
                problems, especially when they connect computer science with financial decision-making.
                Alongside academics, I actively pursue internships and projects that allow me to gain real-world
                experience — from automating financial analysis at <strong>R Systems</strong> to managing a
                $200,000 trading portfolio at <strong>Kalptaru Investments</strong>.
